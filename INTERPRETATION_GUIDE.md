# INTERPRETATION_GUIDE — Correct Ontological Reading

This document removes interpretative ambiguity.

SLIME v0 must NOT be read as:

- a firewall
- a security policy engine
- an access control system
- an AI safety tool
- a monitoring/logging framework
- a cloud-native microservice
- a confinement system

If you apply these models, you are reading it incorrectly.

## SLIME Does Not "Decide"

SLIME does not evaluate intent.
It does not judge.
It does not apply policies.

It defines a structural boundary.

The binary verdict is not a decision.
It is the manifestation of an invariant.

--

Trust Model

Trust is not placed in runtime behavior.
Trust is placed in immutability and invariant sealing.

## What SLIME Actually Is

SLIME v0 is a **structural impossibility primitive**.

It does not:

- decide
- evaluate
- interpret
- negotiate
- tune
- monitor
- optimize

It enforces impossibility at the point of effect.

If an action is impossible:
- it does not fail
- it does not return a reason
- it does not emit feedback

It does not exist.

---

## No Policy. No Governance. No Moral Layer.

SLIME does not allow or forbid.

It defines an actuation boundary where certain actions are structurally absent.

There is no “why”.
There is no configuration.
There are no rules exposed.

---

## No Feedback Principle

SLIME emits no signal for:

- learning
- retry
- boundary probing
- optimization
- tuning

Impossibility produces a non-event.

---

## Local Physical-Like Primitive

SLIME v0 is:

- Linux-first
- local-only
- machine-contained
- fail-closed
- non-distributed
- non-elastic

It is not cloud-native.
It is not scalable infrastructure.
It is not a network service.

---

## Canonical Immutability

SLIME v0 is sealed.

The internal law is immutable.

Development happens around it — never inside it.

---

## Correct Mental Model

Do not ask:

> “How does SLIME secure my system?”

Ask instead:

> “What becomes structurally impossible once SLIME defines the actuation boundary?”

---

## Deployment Model

SLIME v0 is not designed as:

- a containerized microservice
- a cloud-native service
- a distributed component

It is a sealed local appliance.
