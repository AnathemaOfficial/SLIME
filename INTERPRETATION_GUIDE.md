SLIME v0 — Correct Ontological Reading

This document exists to remove interpretative ambiguity.

SLIME v0 must not be read as:

a firewall

a policy engine

an access control system

an AI safety tool

a monitoring or logging framework

a cloud microservice

a confinement system

If you interpret SLIME using any of these frames, you are reading it incorrectly.

What SLIME Actually Is

SLIME v0 is a structural impossibility primitive.

It does not:

decide

evaluate

interpret

negotiate

tune

monitor

optimize

It enforces impossibility at the point of effect.

If an action is impossible, it does not fail.
It does not return a reason.
It does not emit feedback.

It does not exist.

No Policy. No Governance. No Moral Layer.

SLIME does not allow or forbid.

It defines an actuation boundary where certain actions are structurally absent.

There is no “why”.
There is no rule set.
There is no configuration.

No Feedback Principle

SLIME emits no signal for:

learning

tuning

retry

optimization

boundary probing

An impossibility produces a non-event.

No semantic explanation is available.

Local Physical-Like Primitive

SLIME is:

Linux-first

local-only

machine-contained

fail-closed

It is not a distributed service.
It is not cloud-native.
It is not elastic.

It is a sealed local law-layer.

Canonical Immutability

SLIME v0 is sealed.

The internal law is immutable.

Development occurs around it — never inside it.

If you are looking for configuration, customization, or extension of the core:

you are outside the canonical model.

Correct Mental Model

Do not think:

“How does SLIME secure a system?”

Instead ask:

“What becomes structurally impossible once SLIME defines the actuation boundary?”

That is the correct reading.
