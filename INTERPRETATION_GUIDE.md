# INTERPRETATION_GUIDE — Correct Ontological Reading

This document removes interpretative ambiguity.

SLIME v0 must NOT be read as:

- a firewall
- a security policy engine
- an access control system
- an AI safety tool
- a monitoring/logging framework
- a cloud-native microservice
- a confinement system

If you apply these models, you are reading it incorrectly.

---

## SLIME Does Not "Decide"

SLIME does not evaluate intent.
It does not judge.
It does not apply policies.

It defines a structural boundary.

The binary verdict is not a decision.
It is the manifestation of an invariant.

---

## Not a Security Layer

SLIME v0 must not be described as:

- securing an API
- securing a backend
- protecting a system
- hardening infrastructure

SLIME does not secure interfaces.

It defines an actuation boundary where certain effects cannot exist.

If you are looking to secure an API, use API security tools.
SLIME operates at a different conceptual layer.

---

## Trust Model

Trust is not placed in runtime behavior.
Trust is placed in immutability and invariant sealing.

---

## What SLIME Actually Is

SLIME v0 is a **structural impossibility primitive**.

It does not:

- decide
- evaluate
- interpret
- negotiate
- tune
- monitor
- optimize

It enforces impossibility at the point of effect.

If an action is impossible:
- it does not fail
- it does not return a reason
- it does not emit feedback

It does not exist.

---

## No Policy. No Governance. No Moral Layer.

SLIME does not allow or forbid.

It defines an actuation boundary where certain actions are structurally absent.

There is no “why”.
There is no configuration.
There are no rules exposed.

---

## No Feedback Principle

SLIME emits no signal for:

- learning
- retry
- boundary probing
- optimization
- tuning

Impossibility produces a non-event.

---

## Attempt vs Effect

SLIME does not prevent attempts.

Upstream systems may attempt any action.

SLIME only governs the point of effect.

If an action is impossible, no effect occurs.

---

## Local Physical-Like Primitive

SLIME v0 is:

- Linux-first
- local-only
- machine-contained
- fail-closed
- non-distributed
- non-elastic

It is not cloud-native.
It is not scalable infrastructure.
It is not a network service.

---

## Canonical Immutability

SLIME v0 is sealed.

The internal law is immutable.

Development happens around it — never inside it.

---

## Governance Model

Governance exists only at invariant genesis.

SLIME does not eliminate design choice.
It eliminates runtime governance.

Once sealed, the invariant is not negotiable, tunable, or adaptable.

---

## Runtime Assumption

Immutability assumes a sealed runtime environment.

SLIME’s guarantees rely on the integrity of the execution appliance.

If the runtime is compromised, the invariant guarantee is void.

---

## Correct Mental Model

Do not ask:

> “How does SLIME secure my system?”

Ask instead:

> “What becomes structurally impossible once SLIME defines the actuation boundary?”

---

## Deployment Model

SLIME v0 is not designed as:

- a containerized microservice
- a cloud-native service
- a distributed component

It is a sealed local appliance.
