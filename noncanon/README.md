# NON-CANON

This folder contains supporting artifacts that are NOT part of the SLIME v0 canon.

## Status

- CANON = root documents (`README.md`, `CANON.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `READING_RULES.md`) + `specs/`
- NON-CANON = any runnable bundle, deployment scripts, systemd units, test actuators, dashboards

## Rule

Nothing inside `noncanon/` may be cited as "the law".
It exists only to reproduce a deployment shape on Linux and validate the egress path.
