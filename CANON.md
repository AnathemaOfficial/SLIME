# **SLIME v0 — Canon Specification**

**Status:** CANON / SEALED
**Scope:** Minimal, deployable, non-negotiable
**Role:** Product environment enclosing AB-S

---

## 1. Definition

**SLIME v0** is a **sealed execution environment** that applies non-negotiable action limits enforced by **AB-S**, independent of intelligence, intent, configuration, or code quality.

SLIME does not decide.
SLIME does not interpret.
SLIME applies a law that has already been decided.

---

## 2. Position in the SYF Architecture

SLIME v0 sits **between existing systems and the world**.

```
Existing System
      ↓
   SLIME v0
      ↓
    World
        ↓
     (AB-S sealed internally)
```

* **AB-S** is embedded inside SLIME and is **never directly accessible**.
* SLIME is the **only surface visible** to users, operators, or enterprises.
* All actuation passes through SLIME or does not occur.

---

## 3. Core Role

SLIME v0 is the **actuarial membrane** of the SYF power plant.

Its sole function is to:

* allow actuation **only** when authorized by AB-S,
* block all other actions **silently and irreversibly**.

SLIME enforces **impossibility**, not policy.

---

## 4. Modules (Fixed for v0)

SLIME v0 is composed of **four modules**, with no extensibility inside v0.

### 4.1 Ingress

* Accepts **declarative ActionRequests** only.
* No logic, no branching, no heuristics.
* Input format is strict and bounded.

Ingress does **not** validate correctness.
Ingress does **not** interpret intent.

---

### 4.2 AB-S Core (Embedded)

* Phase 7.0 engine.
* Fully opaque.
* No configuration.
* No repair.
* No inspection.

AB-S outputs only:

* `OK(AuthorizedEffect)`
* `Err(Impossibility)`

---

### 4.3 Egress

* Maps `AuthorizedEffect` to **mechanical actuation**.
* Fail-closed by construction.
* No retries.
* No fallback paths.
* No simulation of success.

If actuation cannot occur, **nothing occurs**.

---

### 4.4 Dashboard (Read-Only)

* Observational only.
* Displays events and blocked actions.
* No controls.
* No tuning.
* No influence on execution.

The dashboard **never feeds back** into SLIME.

---

## 5. Inputs

SLIME v0 accepts **only**:

* Declarative ActionRequests (from upstream systems).
* Verdicts from AB-S.

SLIME v0 **does not accept**:

* network signals,
* human overrides,
* confidence scores,
* retries,
* external metrics,
* configuration flags.

---

## 6. Processing Rules

SLIME v0 processing is:

* **Monotone** — no adaptive paths.
* **Stateless for decision-making** — no learning.
* **Deterministic** — identical inputs yield identical outcomes.
* **Fail-closed** — ambiguity results in non-event.

Time is not interpreted.
Absence of authorization is final.

---

## 7. Outputs

SLIME v0 produces only:

* **Authorized physical effect**, or
* **Non-event**.

`Err(Impossibility)` is **not an error**.
It is a terminal state.

No output is generated for learning, tuning, or optimization.

---

## 8. Absolute Prohibitions (Non-Negotiable)

SLIME v0 must never include:

* retries or fallback logic,
* simulated success,
* adaptive thresholds,
* configuration modes,
* debug affordances,
* semantic logging,
* explainability layers,
* UX-driven exceptions,
* policy interpretation,
* calibration parameters.

Any such addition **violates canon**.

---

## 9. Security Model

Security is achieved by **structural impossibility**, not enforcement.

* No feedback → no learning.
* No learning → no circumvention.
* No configuration → no drift.

SLIME does not protect AB-S.
SLIME **prevents access to AB-S entirely**.

---

## 10. Compatibility Statement

SLIME v0 is intentionally minimal.

Future systems may:

* wrap SLIME,
* deploy SLIME,
* observe SLIME,
* connect SLIME to larger environments,

but **nothing may be inserted inside SLIME v0**.

---

## 11. Canonical Statement

> **SLIME applies a law that cannot be negotiated.
> It exposes no controls, offers no explanations, and allows no exceptions.
> What passes through SLIME is physically authorized — everything else does not exist.**

---

**END — SLIME v0 SEALED**
