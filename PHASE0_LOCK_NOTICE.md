Project: SLIME v1  
Phase: 0 — Definition Lock  
Model: B (CoreSpec / Compile-Time Law Specialization)  
Status: SEALED  
Date: 2026-02-18  
Tag: slime-v1-phase0-sealed

## Sealed Document

V1_INVARIANTS.md (FINAL — Model B / CoreSpec)

This document defines the irreversible conceptual baseline of SLIME v1.

---

## Validation Authority (Blind Review)

Team-R independent reviewers:

- KIMI — Ontology & Formal Invariants
- Claude — Normative Discipline & Drift Analysis
- Qwen — Structural & Implementation Surface

All Phase 0 blockers resolved.  
No structural contradictions remain.

---

## Core Guarantees Locked

- No runtime profile injection.
- No runtime trust-root oracle.
- No mutable policy state.
- No configuration channels.
- CoreSpec = compile-time law instantiation.
- Binary identity derived solely from version-controlled source.
- Fail-closed semantics explicit and enumerated.
- Bounded determinism (no constant-time claim).
- Anti-replay strictly outside Core.
- Existential guard clause active.

---

## Boundary of Responsibility

Build toolchain integrity and deployment governance are explicitly outside Core threat model.

If compile-time specialization requires runtime mutation or oracle authority, SLIME v1 SHALL NOT proceed.

---

## Phase 1 Entry Condition

Before Phase 1 begins:

- Tag must be pushed.
- Commit must be immutable.
- Phase 1 adversarial test suite (Option C) must be defined.
- No modification to V1_INVARIANTS.md allowed without version bump.

---

## Seal Statement

> Phase 0 defines the conceptual and structural invariants of SLIME v1.
> From this point forward, implementation must conform to this baseline.
> Any deviation requires a new version and review cycle.
