# SLIME — Canon v0 (SEALED)

This document defines the irreversible conceptual baseline of SLIME v0.

## What SLIME IS

SLIME is an impossibility membrane at the point of effect.

- Not a rules engine.
- Not governance.
- Not an agent.
- Not alignment logic.

It is a law applied to actuation.

## What SLIME IS NOT

- No useful feedback
- No optimization metrics
- No reason codes
- No override
- No configuration

Impossibility is not a failure.
It is a terminal non-event.

## Interfaces (v0)

- Ingress (localhost HTTP)
- AB-S internal binary verdict
- Egress (Unix socket client-only, 32 bytes)
- Read-only dashboard

## Core Axiom

Surveillance → feedback → learning → bypass.

SLIME cuts feedback at the point of effect.
